# Weather App
* A weather app build in Angular 10 with Angular Material Design.
* The app shows the weather forcast for the city of Cape Town
* OpenWeatherMap weather API was used to get the weather forcasts

# Challenges
* The app took me approximately 3-4 days to complete up to where I could.
* Learning and understanding about OpenwatherMap was a bit tricky in the begining.
* I found reading the OpenweatherMap API tricky to read as well in the start.
* My first attempt at building the was with React. Building the app in Angualar was much easier than with React, although I could see why one might pick React over Angular
